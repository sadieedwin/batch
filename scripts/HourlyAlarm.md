# Hourly Reminder Batch Script

This Windows batch script plays an alarm sound and shows a reminder message every hour.  
You can use Task Scheduler to run it once at startup, or keep it running in a loop using the provided loop section.

## Script

```batch
@echo off
:start

rem Play the sound
powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer "C:\Windows\Media\Alarm01.wav").PlaySync()

rem Display the message
msg * "Hourly Reminder: It's time to check this and that and everything!!!"

rem Wait for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
timeout /t 3600

rem Go back to the start of the loop
goto start
```

## Instructions
1. Save the Script:
- Copy the above script into a text editor.
- Save it with a .bat extension, for example: hourly_reminder.bat.

2. Run it Manually:
- Double-click the .bat file to start it.
- It will keep running hourly until you close the window.

3. Optional - Add to Task Scheduler:
- Open Task Scheduler â†’ Create Basic Task.
- Set the trigger to "At log on" or a specific time.
- Set the action to "Start a program" and point it to your .bat file.
- This avoids needing the loop inside the script and lets Task Scheduler handle the timing.

Feel free to adjust the .wav file path or the message text to suit your needs.
